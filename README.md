# Real-Time Event Ticketing System

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
The *Real-Time Event Ticketing System* simulates a dynamic ticketing environment using the *Producer-Consumer pattern* with multi-threading in Java. It allows concurrent ticket releases by vendors and purchases by customers while maintaining data integrity in a shared ticket pool. The system also supports saving and loading configurations for future reuse.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features
- *Concurrency Management*: Implements multi-threading with thread-safe operations to handle ticket releases and purchases simultaneously.
- *Producer-Consumer Pattern*: Vendors act as producers adding tickets, and customers act as consumers retrieving tickets.
- *Persistent Configuration Management*: Save and load multiple configurations, displaying them in a structured table format.
- *Customizable Parameters*: User-defined settings for total tickets, ticket release rate, customer retrieval rate, and maximum ticket capacity.
- *Graceful Shutdown*: Ensures all threads terminate safely when the system stops.
